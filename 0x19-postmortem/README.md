**Issue Summary**

**Duration of the Outage:**
- Start: June 12, 2024, 14:15 UTC
- End: June 12, 2024, 15:45 UTC

**Impact:**
- The e-commerce website was completely inaccessible to users.
- 100% of the users were affected, experiencing a 503 Service Unavailable error.
- All transactions during this period were halted, leading to an estimated revenue loss of $50,000.

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause was a misconfigured Nginx server that failed to handle incoming requests properly after a scheduled update.

**Timeline**

- **14:15 UTC:** Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating a sudden spike in 503 errors.
- **14:16 UTC:** Incident escalated to the on-call engineering team.
- **14:20 UTC:** Initial investigation started with checking server health and network connectivity.
- **14:30 UTC:** Assumed the issue was related to a recent code deployment; rolled back the deployment with no effect.
- **14:45 UTC:** Misleading path identified: suspected database connectivity issues due to similar symptoms in past incidents.
- **15:00 UTC:** Escalated to the Nginx and infrastructure team for deeper investigation.
- **15:20 UTC:** Root cause identified as a misconfigured Nginx server due to a faulty configuration file pushed during the update.
- **15:25 UTC:** Corrected the Nginx configuration and restarted the server.
- **15:30 UTC:** Monitoring confirmed the service was back online and functioning correctly.
- **15:45 UTC:** Full functionality restored and confirmed through multiple checks.

**Root Cause and Resolution**

The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured Nginx server. During a scheduled update, a faulty configuration file was inadvertently deployed. This file included an incorrect directive that caused Nginx to fail to route incoming requests properly, leading to the 503 Service Unavailable errors.

**Resolution:**
1. The Nginx configuration file was corrected by reverting to the last known good configuration.
2. The Nginx server was restarted, which allowed it to reload the correct configuration and resume normal operations.
3. Extensive checks were conducted to ensure the system was functioning correctly before declaring the issue resolved.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

**Improvements and Fixes:**
1. Implement stricter validation and testing processes for configuration changes.
2. Enhance monitoring to detect misconfigurations earlier.
3. Improve rollback procedures to include configuration checks.

**Specific Tasks:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:** Update the Nginx configuration validation script to include additional checks for common misconfiguration errors.
2. **Add Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring for Nginx to alert on configuration errors immediately.
3. **Configuration Testing:** Develop a staging environment specifically for testing Nginx configuration changes before deploying them to production.
4. **Rollback Procedure:** Update the rollback procedures to ensure they include steps for verifying configurations, not just code.
5. **Documentation:** Document the incident and update the runbooks with detailed steps on handling similar incidents in the future.
6. **Training:** Conduct a training session for the engineering team on the updated configuration management and deployment procedures.

By addressing these areas, we aim to reduce the likelihood of similar issues occurring in the future and improve our overall incident response process.
